                <p>When Piston powered fighters appeared in WW1 , these platforms were considered a new technology that is yet to be fully meeting its potential , which then became a major military asset in WW2 with the introduction of long rang bombers, and they certainly spearheaded the 
                   evolution of Aircraft as whole.

                 <p>The First of their kind, these platforms were a first major breakthrough on aviation after they started being used in combat operations, with the use of the jet powered engine which was hundreds of kilometers faster than the fastest propellers
                    at that time capable of outpacing and out-manaveruing anything in the air, certainly scared anyone who saw them scream by in the air.

                    development of aircraft ,and their weapons, The era of Supersonic flight has just began.

           Almost as fast as 2nd generation platforms came ,3rd generation ones were already in the works ,and with it came much needed improvements in reliability  and weapons systems 
           and much faster speeds, with some 3rd generation platforms still being in use to this day.

    <h3><a class="port" href="Aircraft6.html">Fifth Generation</a></h3> 
    <p>
       The future is here, the age of the fifth generation aircraft is fast approaching but its not certain you can spot it in time,
       with the new but curial element of stealth that ensures you can't see it until its too late.
